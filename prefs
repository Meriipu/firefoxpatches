These are the prefs I have that I believe are relevant. 
Some of them were likely removed in firefox 77 but too lazy to shorten the list.

browser.urlbar.trimURLs	false
browser.urlbar.openViewOnFocus  false
browser.urlbar.update1.interventions  false 
browser.urlbar.update1.searchTips false 
browser.urlbar.update2.expandTextOnFocus	false
toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets  true

// note that while this will make the bar not grow in size when focused,
// the bar will still grow outwards in every direction when it drops down.
// This option alone is therefore not really that useful, and instead the
// CSS in userChrome.css is used to never grow outwards (even when dropping).
ui.prefersReducedMotion  1
