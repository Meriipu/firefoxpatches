Subject: [PATCH 5/8] skip the topsites provider due to horrible
 priority-stealing behaviour

even though history was getting sent to the query this provider seems
to somehow have dropped it and returned NOTHING because topsites are
disabled in my setup, leading to the dropmarker doing absolutely
nothing.

With the topsites provider removed, firefox is forced to use the
history one or whatever it is called.
